This \"adopt first, finalize later\" approach denies stakeholders a meaningful opportunity to provide input before a rule takes effect, rendering the eventual rulemaking process performative rather than substantive.\n\n(3) The Systemic Removal of Procedural Safeguards Dismantles the Small Business Safety Net: The RFO does not just change individual rules; it severs the connective tissue that links them together. By removing small business considerations from FAR Parts 10 (Market Research), 6 (Competition), and 11 (Describing Agency Needs), you have effectively created a procedural vacuum. Contracting officers are no longer explicitly prompted to consider a set-aside, consult with the SBA before bundling, or avoid unnec...\n\n(4) Direct Economic Harm to Local Communities: This is not just a regulatory issue; it is a significant economic issue with direct consequences for local economies and jobs in every congressional district. In my district ([Your Congressional District]), small businesses received [$ amount] in federal contracts last year, with [X]% of that coming from set-asides. Already, policies favoring contract consolidation have contributed to a [Y]% decline in the number of unique small business suppliers in my dist...\n\n(5) The Transfer of Risk to Contractors Will Increase Costs and Reduce Competition: The elimination of standard, predictable risk-allocation clauses\u2014most notably the \"Variation in Quantity\" clause from FAR Part 11\u2014is a direct financial threat to my business. This forces us to price for worst-case scenarios, which will either make our bids uncompetitive or increase the ultimate cost to the taxpayer. This change will drive small firms out of the market and reduce competition.---\n\nSpecific Comments on FAR Part 34:\n\nFAR Part 34 governs major system acquisitions \u2014 the complex, long-term projects often led by large primes. The proposed changes continue a trend toward consolidation and remove language that previously emphasized opportunities for small business participation.\n\n(1) The Removal of Phased Development Considerations: The previous FAR encouraged phased development strategies that allowed for modular design, prototyping, and participation by smaller firms. The revised language omits this, favoring large, bundled approaches.\n\n(2) Weakening Oversight of Acquisition Strategies: The new version reduces accountability mechanisms that ensured small businesses were considered in the acquisition planning phase of major systems.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nRestore language requiring that acquisition strategies for major systems include consideration of small business subcontracting, prototyping opportunities, and modular design approaches. Explicitly instruct agencies to include SBA early in the acquisition strategy process."

This is often where bundling, cost creep, and scope changes exclude small businesses.\n\n(1) The Removal of Notification and Documentation Requirements: The new language downplays the need to justify or explain contract changes. This enables quiet rebundling of scope, increasing size and complexity in ways that disadvantage small firms.\n\n(2) Reduced SBA Visibility: When a contract that was once small business\u2013friendly is modified, there should be a safeguard that notifies SBA or offers protest rights. The new rules remove this.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nAdd language requiring that material scope modifications trigger re-evaluation of small business set-aside status, including potential SBA review. Require that significant changes be documented and publicly accessible via FPDS or SAM.gov."

The proposed changes eliminate or weaken clauses that support small business protection, price fairness, and transparency.\n\n(1) The Deletion of Small Business-Focused Clauses: The overhaul removes long-standing clauses that made size status, limitations on subcontracting, and nonmanufacturer rule requirements visible and enforceable. This undermines enforcement of the Small Business Act.\n\n(2) The Shift to \u201cBuying Guides\u201d Instead of Contract Clauses: Some clauses have been replaced with informal language buried in agency-level buying guides or templates. These are not enforceable and reduce transparency and consistency.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nReinstate critical clauses that enforce small business protections \u2014 particularly those connected to FAR Part 19. Clarify that buying guides cannot override regulatory clause requirements and that all FAR clause removals must undergo formal rulemaking."
