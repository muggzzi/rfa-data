    "Comment_Template": "To the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council:\n\nI am writing to express my profound concern about the process and cumulative impact of the Revolutionary FAR Overhaul (RFO) on my small business and the federal industrial base.\n\nSubmitted By:\nName: [FullName], [BusinessTitle]\nCompany: [CompanyName]\nCompany Description: [CompanyDescription]\n\n(1) My Personal Experience: [PersonalStory]\n\n(2) The Flawed \"Adopt First, Finalize Later\" Implementation: The unprecedented use of rolling class deviations to implement massive, government-wide policy changes circumvents the transparent, legally-mandated notice-and-comment process required by the Administrative Procedure Act. This \"adopt first, finalize later\" approach denies stakeholders a meaningful opportunity to provide input before a rule takes effect, rendering the eventual rulemaking process performative rather than substantive.\n\n(3) The Systemic Removal of Procedural Safeguards Dismantles the Small Business Safety Net: The RFO does not just change individual rules; it severs the connective tissue that links them together. By removing small business considerations from FAR Parts 10 (Market Research), 6 (Competition), and 11 (Describing Agency Needs), you have effectively created a procedural vacuum. Contracting officers are no longer explicitly prompted to consider a set-aside, consult with the SBA before bundling, or avoid unnecessarily restrictive schedules. The burden has been shifted from the government to the small business community to police the entire acquisition process, which is an unfair and unsustainable expectation.\n\n(4) Direct Economic Harm to Local Communities: This is not just a regulatory issue; it is a significant economic issue with direct consequences for local economies and jobs in every congressional district. In my district ([Your Congressional District]), small businesses received [$ amount] in federal contracts last year, with [X]% of that coming from set-asides. Already, policies favoring contract consolidation have contributed to a [Y]% decline in the number of unique small business suppliers in my district over the last [Z] years. The RFO, by dismantling the very procedures that ensure local firms can compete, will only accelerate this decline, harming the industrial base and the economic health of our community.\n\n(5) The Transfer of Risk to Contractors Will Increase Costs and Reduce Competition: The elimination of standard, predictable risk-allocation clauses\u2014most notably the \"Variation in Quantity\" clause from FAR Part 11\u2014is a direct financial threat to my business. This forces us to price for worst-case scenarios, which will either make our bids uncompetitive or increase the ultimate cost to the taxpayer. This change will drive small firms out of the market and reduce competition.---\n\nSpecific Comments on FAR Part 6:\n\nFAR Part 6 governs how agencies determine whether a contract should be competed or not. The proposed changes allow agencies to proceed without triggering the small business \u201cRule of Two,\u201d and they remove the long-standing connection between set-aside requirements and competition determinations.\n\n(1) Deleting the \u201cRule of Two\u201d as a Regulatory Trigger: The proposed revisions remove the requirement that contracting officers conduct market research and apply the Rule of Two to determine if small businesses can meet the need. Without this, the government can skip set-asides simply by proceeding under commercial or GSA methods. This subverts the statutory framework that mandates maximum practicable opportunity for small business participation.\n\n(2) Shifting Language from \u201cShall\u201d to \u201cMay\u201d: The new language changes what was a requirement into a discretionary action. This eliminates the enforceable obligation to consider a set-aside first, opening the door to inconsistent implementation and reduced transparency.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nFAR 6.206 must retain the mandatory application of the Rule of Two prior to use of commercial procedures, GSA vehicles, or Best in Class contract vehicles. The discretion now granted to agencies under these revisions should be repealed or at minimum made subject to SBA review and protest."

This breaks the link between research and competition strategy and weakens the Rule of Two. Without this link, small businesses are more easily overlooked.\n\n(2) The Language Now Allows \u201cNarrow\u201d or \u201cStreamlined\u201d Research: While efficiency is important, the proposed text enables agencies to define research as broadly or narrowly as they choose. This makes it harder for small businesses to be \u201cfound\u201d and considered.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nMarket research must retain its role as the factual basis for determining whether small businesses can perform the work. The regulation must preserve the requirement that contracting officers document and justify the results, and SBA must retain the right to challenge inadequate or biased market research findings."

Without this clause, contractors must bid based on worst-case assumptions, inflating prices or choosing not to bid at all. This favors large firms with greater financial buffers.\n\n(2) Missing Language on Avoiding Unnecessarily Restrictive Specs: The old regulation emphasized the importance of not excluding capable vendors through unduly specific or proprietary requirements. The proposed language is silent on this \u2014 and that silence will encourage exclusionary practices.\n\nRecommendation:\n\nRestore FAR 52.211-16 as a standard clause, or explicitly require an alternative clause for quantity flexibility. Reintroduce the safeguard language instructing contracting officers to avoid unnecessarily restrictive statements of work unless justified and approved in writing."
